# TicTacToe

A mediocre Tic-Tac-Toe game that I created at work and then finished at home.  

If I had more time, then I would...
- make a replay option
- confirm move feature
- more error handling
- better console display
- better file/code organization & readability 


How to play?
- clone the repository
- ensure that you have all things necessary to run java
- run code
- play in console :)
